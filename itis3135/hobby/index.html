            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>My name is Alberto Murrieta, and I have been boxing for over 10 years. I started boxing when I was 10 years old, and it has been a significant part of my life ever since.</p>
            <p>I have been boxing since I was 10. I got introduced to the sport by my aunt and I hated it at first. However, as I continued to train and improve, I started to fall in love with it. Then it was time to spar and I got scared all over again. After I got in the ring and got punched a couple of times, I wasn't as afraid anymore. A year later, I had my first fight and won.üí™üèª</p>

            <h2>What is Boxing?</h2>
            <p>Boxing is a sport that involves two individuals, typically wearing the appropriate protective gear, who throw punches at each other in a ring. The objective is to score points by landing punches on the opponent while avoiding being hit.</p>
            <p>Boxing is one of the oldest combat sports, with evidence dating back to at least 3000 BCE. Its formal development began in ancient Greece, where it was an official Olympic sport in 688 BCE.</p>

        <section id="when">
            <h2>When</h2>
            <p>I am actually the boxing coach here at UNCC. We usually train in the evenings on Monday and Wednesday from 8pm to 10 pm and on Friday from 6:30pm to 8:30 pm.</p>
            <p>The days that I am able to train my self is usually on Tuesday and Thursday evenings or the weekend, if I'm not able to train during the week.</p>

        <section id="where">
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <p>I usually train at UNCC. It's a great gym with excellent facilities and a supportive community of boxers. The boxing club is just one big family.</p>
            <p>I started the boxing club at UNCC in 2023 when I first started college. I started with around 10 members and now we are up to at least 30-40 members that actively train.</p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Sometimes we do partner drills where one boxer practices their technique while the other provides resistance. This helps to simulate real fight conditions and improve overall performance.</p>
            <P>There are gyms that help us out with training, whether it be sparring or having us over at their gym to train in a real boxing gym. </P>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why I do it?</h2>
            <p>I box for several reasons. First and foremost, I love the sport itself. The combination of physical and mental challenges keeps me engaged and motivated to improve.</p>
            <p>The second reason is that it brings people together. Boxing has a unique way of fostering camaraderie and teamwork among those who do the sport. It creates lifelong friendships and bonds that extend beyond the ring. You beat each other up and hug it out afterwards.</p>
            <p>Finally, the most IMPORTANT reason... my mom. She joined me when I first started boxing and next thing you know, she's in my corner at the Junior Olympics.</p>
